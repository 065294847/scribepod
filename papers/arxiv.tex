\title{It's not every day that new discoveries are made in the human brain.}

\section{abstract}The central nervous system is lined by meninges, classically known as dura, arachnoid, and pia mater. We show the existence of a fourth meningeal layer that compartmentalizes the subarachnoid space in the mouse and human brain, designated the subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM). SLYM is morpho- and immunophenotypically similar to the mesothelial membrane lining of peripheral organs and body cavities, and it encases blood vessels and harbors immune cells. Functionally, the close apposition of SLYM with the endothelial lining of the meningeal venous sinus permits direct exchange of small solutes between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood, thus representing the mouse equivalent of the arachnoid granulations. The functional characterization of SLYM provides fundamental insights into brain immune barriers and fluid transport.


\{first easy introduction}It's not every day that new discoveries are made in the human brain.
But that's exactly what happened in a new Danish-led study published in the journal Science. The study points to the existence of a brain cortex that was previously unknown. This means that the brain has four hindbrains in total.
If the newly discovered meninges are recognised as a separate layer of the brain, it suggests that all anatomy books on the brain should be rewritten to include the SLYM (Subarachnoid Lymphatic-like Membrane). This is reported by Ritzau.
Both American and Danish researchers from the University of Copenhagen and Rochester Medical Center in New York, among others, have been responsible for the discovery


SLYM has an important function when it comes to the brain's purification system.
That's why researchers hope the discovery of the super-thin meninges could lead to a better understanding of Alzheimer's and other diseases in which the brain breaks down.
Here, the newly found fourth brain layer is seen between the brain layers pia mater (choroid) and arachnoid (spider's membrane):


How was it discovered?
It's incredibly difficult to research brain disorders, and that's among the reasons why SLYM has only now been discovered.
The first author of the study is Kjeld Møllgård, an 80-year-old professor at the University of Copenhagen.
"I've been researching the brain for more than 50 years, so I think it's very funny that at 80 I'm publishing my biggest scientific result in all these years," he tells Videnskab.dk.
Kjeld Møllgård, who developed the clever method, has found the newly discovered cortex.
Instead of removing the brains immediately from the study mice, the researchers chose to cut them off and put them in a solution for a month to soften the skulls.


The whole head was then cut into ultra-thin slices without destroying the meninges, which could then be studied under a microscope.
The mice were genetically modified using an immunostaining technique that uses antibodies that bind to molecules in the cells, giving the different types of cells colours that allow them to be distinguished.
This allowed the researchers to discover that the mice had a SLYM meninges, which are equipped with cells containing the molecule PROX 1, which signals the cells to behave like lymphatic vessels.
The researchers then drilled a hole in the skull of a human and cut the tissue sample into small slices - as well as immunostaining the sample - to demonstrate that SLYM was also present in human brains.
Part of the brain's washing machine
The newfound SLYM meninges lie between the pia mater and arachnoid meninges, which are the two innermost membranes enclosed by the more powerful dura mater membrane.
As the name suggests, the newly invented meninges are lymphatic-like, which has led researchers to link the function of the membrane to the brain's 'cleaning system'.
The system is called the glymophilic system, which behaves a bit like the lymphatic system known for the rest of the body, where a network of lymphatic vessels transports clear fluid around the body.
In this case, the theory is that the glymphatic system cleans dirty fluid filled with dangerous waste products into clean fluid, and here it suggests that the lymphatic structure of the SLYM divides the dirty and clean fluids into two compartments.
"This means that the glymophilic system, which cleans the brain when we sleep, gets clean fluid in when you have a healthy brain, while the dirty fluid can drain out another way," researcher Maiken Nedergaard from Rochester Medical Center told Ritzau.
For example, if you don't have a healthy brain, waste products found in the dirty fluid often build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.
Previous research has also shown that a possible cause of diseases in which the brain breaks down itself may have something to do with a fault in the patient's glymfactic system.

\{second easy introduction}A new human meninges has emerged

Brain Disorders
Danish and American researchers have discovered a previously unknown brain structure in humans. It's a super-thin membrane made up of just one layer of cells - and it's part of the brain's immune system.
Kjeld Møllgård - Professor of Neuroanatomy at the Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen (KU) - has taught thousands of Danish medical students about the structure of the brain for more than 50 years.
"We have three cerebral cortexes - dura, arachnoidea and pia," Møllgård has told one group of medical students after another. Until a few years ago, when he realised that it's not like that at all - and it was an experience he'll never forget:


Professor Kjeld Møllgård from the Panum Institute at the University of Copenhagen (KU) was the man who suddenly saw the previously unknown brain on a microscope photo. Møllgård is a professor of neuroanatomy. He was rector of KU from 1994-2002. 
Møllgård, who turned 80 this autumn, was sitting in his office at the Panum Institute that day, studying advanced microscope photographs of sliced mammal brains.
The brains came from genetically engineered mice, all of which had their entire heads removed after euthanasia and then sliced into ultra-thin slices from ear to ear. It may sound laborious, but the point of doing it that way - rather than just taking out the brain itself and slicing it - was to preserve all the brain structures. And it turned out to be a wise strategy.
Actually, Kjeld Møllgård was looking for lymphatic vessels in the brain - he was doing this by seeing where in the sample particular dyes bound - when he suddenly realised that the microscope photo also revealed a very delicate and hitherto unknown membrane:
Further studies showed that it was meninges number four - and analysis of human brain tissue later confirmed that this membrane, now officially named SLYM, also exists in the human brain.
This is the finding of a research article just published in Science, one of the world's most important scientific journals.
Kjeld Møllgård describes the discovery of SLYM as the "most important achievement" of his long research career, adding that he finds it "quite funny that it happens to me at this age".
Brainwashing
The genetically engineered mice Kjeld Møllgård studied were given to him by another brain researcher - Professor Maiken Nedergaard from the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at KU and the University of Rochester in the US.
Maiken Nedergaard has for a number of years, with support from the Lundbeck Foundation, been researching the glymophilic system - also known by the popular name of the brain's dishwasher. It is a biological system, an advanced pipeline, which in humans and other mammals ensures that the brain continuously gets rid of harmful waste products, such as broken down proteins.
This washing up occurs mainly during sleep, when the brain opens its internal doors, gates and pathways to allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow through. Humans produce about 500 ml of CSF a day, and as the fluid drains out of the brain via veins, nerves and lymphatic vessels, the brain's waste products are flushed out with it. In principle, it's like household waste water going down the drain.
Maiken Nedergaard was the leader of the international research team that published the existence of the glymopathic system in 2013 - and she has been researching how this system works ever since. Including what the brain's plumbing looks like in more detail? And how the system ensures that clean cerebrospinal fluid flows in and that dirty cerebrospinal fluid is later drained away - without mixing?
Maiken Nedergaard is a professor at the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Rochester.


She was the leader of the international research team that in 2013 demonstrated the existence of the glymophilic system - the 'brain's dishwasher' - which keeps the brain free of harmful waste products. SLYM - the newly discovered brain membrane - also appears to be crucially involved in this process.
To carry out such a detailed mapping, it is of great importance to know the anatomy of the brain-lymphatic vessels, says Maiken Nedergaard:
"And it's not easy. We have seen in previous mouse experiments that in a mammalian brain there are lymphatic vessels that connect the brain directly to the skull. But if you take a mouse brain out of the skull before you study it, you're going to tear up these vessels. And that's why I asked Professor Kjeld Møllgård, who's an authority on neuroanatomy - not least when it comes to meninges and brain barriers - if he could help me analyse some mouse brains by slicing whole heads of genetically engineered mice into very thin slices. With skin, hair, teeth, bones and brain - the whole thing, simply.
He wanted to, and the fact that in addition to identifying lymphatic vessels in the samples, he also found a previously unknown fourth meninges, SLYM, is amazing. Both because the discovery means that the neuroanatomical textbooks must now be fundamentally revised on this point - and this type of revision is certainly not something you see every day - but it is also fantastic because studies of the previously unknown meninges can be used, among other things, to develop a new understanding of Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases," says Maiken Nedergaard.
Discovery had to be documented
The four cerebral cortexes - pia, SLYM, arachnoid and dura - together form a protective barrier system that encloses the human brain. In addition, the barrier system ensures that the brain is constantly bathed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
When Kjeld Møllgård discovered SLYM, the fourth meninges, he could see that it was located in the cavity between the pia and the arachnoid. But although the structure he saw in the microscope photo seemed unmistakably to be a meninges, it took a lot of complicated investigation to establish it with scientific certainty. It was also important to explore the functions of the SLYM - and all this took time.
These investigations were carried out in close collaboration between Kjeld Møllgård and Maiken Nedergaard and a number of researchers at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Rochester, who are also behind the scientific article in Science.
In addition to documenting the existence of the fourth meninges, the Science article points to various properties that characterize it. These include the role of SLYM in the brain's immune system. Among other things, the Danish and American researchers have found that SLYM contains special immune cells that monitor whether something is wrong in the brain.
Part of this monitoring is carried out by the immune cells, which continuously scan the cerebrospinal fluid for signs of infection or cell damage, and if they detect problems, they activate the immune system. The researchers in Maiken Nedergaard's lab were able to measure this when they provoked SLYM in cell experiments by inflicting infections and mechanical damage. These experiments also showed that the fourth meninges weaken and can leak as their cells age.
Another property that characterises SLYM is its role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. Here, researchers from Maiken Nedergaard's lab were able to show in experiments that SLYM is able to direct fluid movements - and that SLYM also appears to be crucially involved in keeping clean cerebrospinal fluid separate from dirty cerebrospinal fluid.
These two properties will now be further explored to provide new insights into Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. And there is a lot of logic in investigating this, because a well-functioning circulation of CSF - and an efficient disposal of degraded proteins and other waste products - is of great importance for keeping the brain healthy, says Maiken Nedergaard:
"In Alzheimer's, for example, there is a build-up of degraded proteins that should otherwise have been flushed out of the brain. If we can find out in more detail how the SLYM - the fourth meninges - works, it could increase our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. And, in turn, increase our chances of developing new treatments for these diseases."
The fourth meninges discovered by Professor Kjeld Møllgård have been officially named SLYM. It is an abbreviation of: Subarachnoid LYmphatic-like Membrane.

\{technical introduction} emerging evidence supports the concept that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acts as a quasi-lymphatic system in the central nervous system (I). Cardiovascular pulsatility drives CSF inflow along periarterial spaces into deep brain regions $(2,3)$, where CSF exchange with interstitial fluid, facilitated by glial aquaporin 4 ( $\mathrm{AQP} 4$ ) water channels (4), takes place. Fluid and solutes from the neuropil are cleared along multiple routes, including perivenous spaces and cranial nerves, for ultimate export to the venous circulation via meningeal and cervical lymphatic vessels $(5,6)$. CSF reabsorption may also occur at the sinuses via the arachnoid granulations-although this has not been described in rodents (7-10). Despite the efforts dedicated to studying CSF flow along the glymphatic-lymphatic path, it remains to be determined how CSF is transported within the large cavity of the subarachnoid space $(11,12)$. In this study, we explored how CSF and immune cell trafficking are organized within the subarachnoid space surrounding the brains of mice and humans.

The meningeal membranes were first analyzed by in vivo two-photon microscopy in the somatosensory cortex of Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$reporter mice (Prox1, prospero homeobox protein 1; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein). Prox1 is a transcription factor that determines lymphatic fate $(13,14)$. Second harmonic generation was used to visualize unlabeled collagen fibers, while the vascular volume waslabeled by a Cascade Blue conjugated dextran, and astrocytes were labeled by sulforhodamine 101 (SR101, intraperitoneally) $(15,16)$. Below the parallel-oriented collagen bundles in dura, we noted a continuous monolayer of flattened Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$cells intermixed with loosely organized collagen fibers. This subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM) divides the subarachnoid space into an outer superficial compartment and an inner deep compartment lining the brain (Fig. 1A). Quantitative in vivo analysis of the somatosensory cortex revealed that the thickness of SLYM itself was $14.2 \pm 0.5 \mu \mathrm{m}$, hence thinner than dura (21.8 $\pm 1.3 \mu \mathrm{m}, n=6$ mice). The dura vasculature is surrounded by collagen fibers, whereas SLYM covers the subarachnoid vessels. The organization and calibers of the two sets of vasculature also exhibit distinct differences (Fig. 1, B and C).

A key question is whether SLYM constitutes an impermeable membrane that functionally compartmentalizes the subarachnoid space. To test this, Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice were first injected with 1- $\mu \mathrm{m}$ microspheres conjugated to a red fluorophore into the subdural outer superficial compartment of the subarachnoid space along with an injection of 1- $\mu \mathrm{m}$ microspheres conjugated to a blue fluorophore distributed within the inner deep subarachnoid space compartment by cisterna magna injection (Fig. 2A). In vivo two-photon microscopy showed that the red microspheres were confined to the outer superficial compartment, whereas the blue microspheres remained trapped in the inner deep subarachnoid space compartment. Quantitative analysis showed that the $1-\mu \mathrm{m}$ microspheres did not cross SLYM from either side. Yet, many solutes in $\mathrm{CSF}$, such as cytokines and growth factors, are considerably smaller than $1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter (17). Therefore, we sought to determine whether a small tracer could pass through SLYM. In these experiments, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)dextran (3 kDa) was administered into the deep inner subarachnoid space via the cisterna magna in Proxl-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice. In six mice, the small tracer did not cross the EGFP-expressing

Representative 3D reconstruction of the z-stacks. The vasculature in dura (magenta) is embedded in collagen fibers (white). In contrast, the vasculature in the subarachnoid space (red) is overlaid by SLYM (green). (C) Orthogonal sections through the z-stack show that the vasculature in dura is surrounded by collagen fibers. SLYM is located beneath dura, in close apposition SLYM (Fig. 2B and fig. S1). Yet, in mice with dural damage and leakage of CSF, the tracer was observed on both sides of the $\mathrm{EGFP}^{+}$membrane (fig. S1). Thus, SLYM divides the subarachnoid space into an upper superficial and a lower deep compartment for solutes $\geq 3 \mathrm{kDa}$. SLYM is therefore a barrier that limits the exchange of most peptides and proteins, such as amyloid- $\beta$ and tau, between the upper and lower subarachnoid space compartments.

Live brain imaging avoids fixation artifacts (18) but cannot immunophenotypically char- acterize the meningeal membranes. To preserve the integrity of the meningeal membranes, sections were next obtained from whole heads of Proxl-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$cells lined the ventral parts of the entire brain surface (Fig. 3A). Immunolabeling showed that the Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$ SLYM cells were positive for another lymphatic marker, podoplanin (PDPN) (19), but not for the lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1) (20) (Fig. 3, A, lower right panels, and D). SLYM also labeled for the cellular retinoic acid- binding protein 2 (CRABP2) (Fig. 3, A and D), which is restrictively expressed in dural and arachnoid cells during early development (21). In contrast to SLYM, lymphatic vessels in dura were positive for all the classical lymphatic antigens, Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}, \mathrm{PDPN}^{+}, \mathrm{LYVE1}^{+}$, and VEGFR3 $^{+}$, but was $\mathrm{CRABP2}^{-}$(fig. S2). Notably, analysis of adult human cerebral cortex depicted that above the pia mater, a $\mathrm{CRABP}^{+}$/ $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+}$membrane was present in the entire subarachnoid space (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, SLYM also surrounds the human brain. We Fig. 2. SLYM represents a barrier that subdivides the subarachnoid space into two compartments.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_01_23_6c97369f44590e404478g-2}infer that the SLYM monolayer of Prox1-EGFP cells organizes into a membrane rather than vessel structures and exhibits a distinctive set of lymphatic markers (Fig. 3E). To distinguish SLYM from the structures forming the arachnoid mater, we used immunolabeling against claudin-11 (CLDN-11), a main constituent of the tight junctions that create the arachnoid barrier cell layer (ABCL) (22). CLDN11 was densely expressed in ABCL as well as in the stromal cells of the choroid plexus, but SLYM was CLDN-11 (fig. S3, A and B). Additionally, ABCL was distinctively positive for E-cadherin (E-Cad) (Fig. 3C), as previously reported $(23,24)$. We also compared SLYM to the arachnoid trabeculae (25), collagen-enriched structures that span the subarachnoid space, finding that cells surrounding the arachnoid trabeculae are Prox1-EGFP $/$ /LYVE1 $^{-}$(fig. S3C). Pial cells covering the cortical surface also exhibited an immune-labeling profile that differed from that of SLYM (figs. S3 and S4). We conclude that SLYM constitutes a fourth meningeal layer surrounding the mouse and human brain displaying lymphatic-like features (Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$, PDPN $^{+}$, LYVE1 ${ }^{-}$, CRABP2 ${ }^{+}$, VEGFR3 $^{-}$, CLDN-11 $^{-}$, and E-Cad ${ }^{-}$) and that SLYM is phenotypically distinct from dura, the arachnoid, and pia mater (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, SLYM expressed PDPN, sharing a trait with the mesothelium lining the body cavities (26). Accordingly, we observed $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+}$cells lining the kidney, as well as $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+}$podocytes in the kidneys of adult C57BL/6J mice (fig. S5A). In a human fetus, a $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+}$membrane corresponding to pericardium, pleura, and peritoneum encases the developing heart, lungs, and intestinal tract, respectively. $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+}$lym- phatic vessels were also observed in the lungs and intestinal tract (fig. S5, B and C). Thus, SLYM may represent the brain mesothelium and, as such, covers blood vessels in the subarachnoid space (Fig. 1) (26). The mesothelium is present where tissues slide against each other and is believed to act as a boundary lubricant to ease movement (27). Physiological pulsations induced by the cardiovascular system, respiration, and positional changes of the head are constantly shifting the brain within the cranial cavity. SLYM may, like other mesothelial membranes, reduce friction between the brain and skull during such movements.

Does SLYM have additional functions? The arachnoid villi and granulations are defined as protrusions of the arachnoid membrane into the lateral walls of the sinus veins and are believed to act as passive filters that drain Fig. 4. SLYM forms subarachnoid villus-like structures at the venous sinus walls in mice. (A and B) Schematic diagrams illustrating the region of interest. (C and D) Parasagittal consecutive sections from a decalcified mouse whole head stained for (C) the SLYM marker Prox1-EGFP and (D) the arachnoid barrier cell marker E-Cad. Rectangular insets on the left in (B), (C), and (D) are shown in higher magnification on the right. A Prox1-positive arachnoid villuslike structure (AV) and a vein from the dorsal venous system are in direct contact with the transverse sinus wall (SW), which is lacking an intervening $A B C L$ [inset in (C) and (D)]. The $A B C L$ [arrows in inset in (C)] are not stained for Prox1, in contrast to the strongly stained SLYM layer, whereas the opposite pattern of reactivity is depicted in the adjacent section [inset in (D)], where $A B C L$ is positive for $\mathrm{E}-\mathrm{Cad}$ and SLYM is negative. Arrowheads point to pia. In (C), the narrow dura layer, indicated by small arrows, is facing the venous endothelial layer (VEC), indicated by slender darker arrows.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2023_01_23_6c97369f44590e404478g-3}CSF from the subarachnoid space into the venous sinus system (7-10). The arachnoid villi and granulations are present in the brains of humans, primates, and larger animals such as dogs, but not in the brains of rodents $(28,29)$. We critically reexamined this issue to evaluate the distribution of SLYM in relation to the superior sagittal and transverse sinus. Sections obtained from decalcified heads of Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice showed that Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$ SLYM cells often were in direct contact with the venous sinus endothelial cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, the arachnoid barrier cell layer (CLDN$11^{+} / \mathrm{E}^{-\mathrm{Cad}^{+}}$), which normally separates dura from the subarachnoid space, was lacking in discrete areas allowing SLYM to directly contact the venous sinus wall (Fig. 4B). Prox1$\mathrm{EGFP}^{+}$SLYM cells were not positive for CLDN11 or E-Cad, which distinguish the arachnoid barrier cell layer (fig. S6).

Are the close appositions of SLYM and the venous endothelial cells permeable, allowing the exchange of small molecules between blood and CSF? To test this, we used the principles of bioluminescence, wherein the convergence, in the same compartment, of an enzyme with its substrate is needed to trigger light emission. First, we delivered the luciferase enzyme from Oplophorus gracilirostris (NanoLuc) fused to the fluorescence tag mNeongreen (GeNL, 44 kDa) (30) into CSF via the cisterna magna of wild-type (C57bl/6) mice, and allowed it to circulate for $30 \mathrm{~min}$ to ensure thorough distribution by the glymphatic system. The distribution of GeNL was verified by mNeongreen fluorescence. Then, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-impermeable substrate fluorofurimazine (FFz, $433 \mathrm{Da}$ ) (31) was administered intravenously (fig. S7, A to C) (32). After intravenous injection of $\mathrm{FFz}$, a bright bioluminescence signal catalyzed by GeNL was detected specifically near the large venous sinus wall (fig. S7, A and B). The bioluminescence signal was particularly strong around the confluence of sinuses (fig. S7B). The distribution of the bioluminescence signal was quantified by plotting the mean signal intensity profiles perpendicular to the venous wall of the transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus. The mean bioluminescence signal profiles intersected with the fluorescence signal profiles of the intravascular tracer (TMR-dextran, $70 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) or with shadow imaging of the inverted GeNL signal outlining the vascular wall (fig. S7C). Thus, the bioluminescence signal was restricted to the venous wall of the two major sinuses lacking a $\mathrm{BBB}$ $(33,34)$, consistent with the notion that $\mathrm{FFz}$ is $\mathrm{BBB}$-impermeable and requires the catalyzation enzyme NanoLuc to generate photons (fig. S7, A to C). In control experiments, $\mathrm{FFz}$ was delivered intravenously, while the GeNL injection into CSF was omitted. In these control experiments, no bioluminescence signal was detected from the exposed cortex, including from the sinus venous wall (fig. S7D). In another set of control experiments, GeNL was injected into the soft ear tissue, while $\mathrm{FFz}$ was delivered intravenously. Consistent with the notion that peripheral blood vessels are leaky (11), light emission was clearly observed in the region of the ear injected with NanoLuc but not in surrounding noninjected regions of the same ear. No signal was observed in the venous compartment, likely reflecting that blood flow rapidly diluted the bioluminescence signal (fig. S7E). Together, this analysis shows that a small molecule, $\mathrm{FFz}$, can enter the central nervous system (CNS) from the blood and activate an enzyme, NanoLuc, present in CSF, resulting in the generation of photons along the wall of the venous sinus. On the basis of the juxtaposition of SLYM and the venous endothelium in histological examination (Fig. 4A), the selective generation of photons when luciferase was injected into CSF, and the fact that the substrate was pres- ent in the vascular compartment (fig. S7, A to $\mathrm{C})$, we propose that the apposition of the venous endothelia and SLYM represents rodent arachnoid villus-like structures, comparable to those in human brain.

The mesothelium surrounding peripheral organs acts as an immune barrier (26). Does SLYM also impede the entry of exogenous particles into CSF? In vivo two-photon imaging of Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice injected intravenously with rhodamine $6 \mathrm{G}$ (Rhod6G) to label leukocytes (35) showed that a large number of Rhod $6 \mathrm{G}^{+}$myeloid cells are embedded in SLYM (Fig. 5A). The number of Rhod $6 \mathrm{G}^{+}$ leukocytes in dura and SLYM was directly comparable, suggesting a prominent role of SLYM in CNS immune responses, which supports the finding that leptomeninges are densely populated with immune cells (36) (Fig. 5A). How do systemic inflammation and aging affect the immune cell populations residing in SLYM? Ex vivo analysis of brain sections obtained from Prox1-EGFP ${ }^{+}$mice showed that,

(C) The percentage of area covered by ${\operatorname{CD} 45^{+}}^{+}$cells was significantly increased both in aged (12- to 13-month-old) mice and in response to inflammation (LPS $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, ip, 24 hours). Values are expressed as mean $\pm$ SEM, two-tailed unpaired $t$ test with Welch's correction, $P<0.005, n=3$ mice. (D) LYVE1 macrophages were also found in the SLYM layer, being more prominent in aged and LPS-treated animals than in healthy young Prox1-EGFP mice. (E) The mannose receptor CD206 was detected at similar levels in the young, aged, and LPS-treated groups, suggesting that SLYM may act as a niche for border-associated mouse macrophages. Significance shown as ${ }^{*} P<0.05$. Ctr, control. in the control group, CD45 $5^{+}$cells were abundant, located mostly along pial vessels in the surface of the brain (Fig. 5B). This observation, together with the significant increase in ${\mathrm{CD} 45^{+}}^{+}$in inflammation-prone conditions [aging and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight, intraperitoneally (ip), 24 hours] (Fig. 5C), suggests that SLYM can act as a CD45 ${ }^{+}$recruiting and/or proliferating site in pathological conditions. Of note, the dose of LPS used $(4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg})$ did not affect the BBB (fig. S8). Additional immune markers showed that LYVE1 ${ }^{+}$(Fig. 5D), $\mathrm{CD} 206^{+}$(Fig. 5E), and CD68 ${ }^{+}$(fig. S9) macrophages can be found in SLYM, together with dendritic cells (CD11c ${ }^{+}$) (fig. S9). Despite the absence of $\mathrm{CD}^{+}{ }^{+}$and $\mathrm{CD} 19^{+}$lymphocytes (fig. S9), our results indicate that SLYM functions as a niche for immunological surveillance. Thus, in young, healthy mice, SLYM hosts CD45 ${ }^{+}$ cells, but the number and diversity of innate immune cells rapidly expands in LPS-induced inflammation and was also significantly altered in aged mice. We conclude that SLYM fulfills the characteristics of a mesothelium by acting as an immune barrier that prevents exchange of small solutes between the outer and inner subarachnoid space compartments and by covering blood vessels in the subarachnoid space.

\section{Discussion}
The critical roles of the meningeal membranes lining the brain have only recently been acknowledged $(5,37)$. It is now known that CSF is drained by a network of lymphatic vessels in the meninges and that suppression of this drainage accelerates protein aggregation and cognitive decline in animal models of neurodegeneration (38-40). SLYM is Proxl $^{+} /$ $\mathrm{PDPN}^{+} / \mathrm{LYVE1}^{-}$/CRABP2 ${ }^{+}$/VEGFR3 ${ }^{-}$/CLDN-11 $/$ E-Cad ${ }^{-}$and thereby distinct from the traditional meningeal membranes, including dura, arachnoid, and pia, as well as the meningeal lymphatic vessels and the arachnoid trabecula. SLYM subdivides the subarachnoid space into two compartments, suggesting that CSF transport is more organized than currently acknowledged. For example, SLYM covering the vasculature in the inner subarachnoid space will guide CSF influx along the penetrating arterioles into the brain parenchyma without circulating solutes present in the outer subarachnoid space compartment. Yet the discovery of a fourth meningeal layer, SLYM, has several implications beyond fluid transport. The observation that SLYM is a barrier for CSF solutes that have a molecular weight larger than $3 \mathrm{kDa}$ will require more detailed studies but indicates a need to redefine the concept of CNS barriers to include SLYM. The meningeal membranes are hosts to myeloid cells responsible for immune surveillance of the CNS $(5,37)$, and SLYM, owing to its close association with the brain surfaces, is likely to play a prominent role in this surveillance. Herein, we showed a large increase in the number and diversity of immune cells residing in SLYM in response to acute inflammation and natural aging. Physical rupture of SLYM could, by altering CSF flow patterns, explain the prolonged suppression of glymphatic flow after traumatic brain injury as well as the heightened posttraumatic risk of developing Alzheimer's disease $(41,42)$. Rupture of SLYM will also permit the direct passage of immune cells from the skull bone marrow $(33,43)$ into the inner subarachnoid space, with direct access to the brain surfaces, possibly explaining the prolonged neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury (44). SLYM may also be directly involved in CNS immunity, in addition to being host to many immune cells. Lymphatic-like tissues can transform quickly in the setting of inflammation, which in the brain may be of notable relevance for diseases such as multiple sclerosis (45).

\{background}In anatomy, the meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/,[1][full citation needed][2] singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/or /ˈmɛnɪŋks/[3]), from Ancient Greek μῆνιγξ (mēninx) 'membrane'[4]) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system.[5]
Structure
Dura mater
The dura mater (Latin: tough mother[6]) (also rarely called meninx fibrosa or pachymeninx) is a thick, durable membrane, closest to the skull and vertebrae. The dura mater, the outermost part, is a loosely arranged, fibroelastic layer of cells, characterized by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen,[citation needed] and significant extracellular spaces. The middle region is a mostly fibrous portion. It consists of two layers: the endosteal layer, which lies closest to the skull, and the inner meningeal layer, which lies closer to the brain.[7] It contains larger blood vessels that split into the capillaries in the pia mater. It is composed of dense fibrous tissue, and its inner surface is covered by flattened cells like those present on the surfaces of the pia mater and arachnoid mater. The dura mater is a sac that envelops the arachnoid mater and surrounds and supports the large dural sinuses carrying blood from the brain toward the heart.
The dura has four areas of infolding:
•   Falx cerebri, the largest, sickle-shaped; separates the cerebral hemispheres. Starts from the frontal crest of frontal bone and the crista galli running to the internal occipital protuberance.
•   Tentorium cerebelli, the second largest, crescent-shaped; separates the occipital lobesfrom cerebellum. The falx cerebri attaches to it giving a tentlike appearance.
•   Falx cerebelli, vertical infolding; lies inferior to the tentorium cerebelli, separating the cerebellar hemispheres.
•   Diaphragma sellae, smallest infolding; covers the pituitary gland and sella turcica.

Arachnoid mater[edit]
Main article: Arachnoid mater

The middle element of the meninges is the arachnoid mater, or arachnoid membrane, so named because of its resemblance to a spider web. It cushions the central nervous system. This thin, transparent membrane is composed of fibrous tissue and, like the pia mater, has an outer layer of tightly packed flat cells, forming the arachnoid barrier.[8]
The shape of the arachnoid does not follow the convolutions of the surface of the brain and so looks like a loosely fitting sac. In particular, in the region of the brain a large number of fine filaments called arachnoid trabeculae pass from the arachnoid through the subarachnoid space to blend with the tissue of the pia mater. The arachnoid barrier has no extracellular collagen and is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura.
The arachnoid barrier layer is characterized by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface toward the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid reticular layer.
Pia mater[edit]
Main article: Pia mater
The pia mater (Latin: tender mother[9]) is a very delicate membrane. It is the meningeal envelope that firmly adheres to the surfaces of the brain and spinal cord, following all of the brain's contours (gyri and sulci). It is a very thin membrane composed of fibrous tissue covered on its outer surface by a sheet of flat cells thought to be impermeable to fluid. The pia mater is pierced by blood vessels to the brain and spinal cord, and its capillariesnourish the brain.
Leptomeninges
The arachnoid and pia mater are sometimes together called the leptomeninges,[10] literally "thin meninges" (Greek: λεπτός "leptos"—"thin"). Acute meningococcal meningitis can lead to an exudate within the leptomeninges along the surface of the brain.[11] Because the arachnoid is connected to the pia by cob-web like strands, it is structurally continuous with the pia, hence the name pia-arachnoid or leptomeninges. They are responsible for the production of beta-trace protein (prostaglandin D2 synthase), a major cerebrospinal fluid protein.[12]
Subarachnoid space

The subarachnoid space is the space that normally exists between the arachnoid and the pia mater. It is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and continues down the spinal cord. Spaces are formed from openings at different points along the subarachnoid space; these are the subarachnoid cisterns, which are filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
The dura mater is attached to the skull, whereas in the spinal cord, the dura mater is separated from the vertebrae by a space called the epidural space, which contains fat and blood vessels. The arachnoid is attached to the dura mater, while the pia mater is attached to the central nervous system tissue. When the dura mater and the arachnoid separate through injury or illness, the space between them is the subdural space. There is a subpial space underneath the pia mater that separates it from the glia limitans.
Clinical significance
Injuries involving the meninges, can result in a hemorrhage and two types of hematoma.[13]
•   A subarachnoid hemorrhage is acute bleeding under the arachnoid; it may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma.[14]
•   A subdural hematoma is a hematoma (collection of blood) located in a separation of the arachnoid from the dura mater. The bridging veins that connect the dura mater and the arachnoid are torn, usually during an accident, and blood leaks into this area.
•   An epidural hematoma, bleeding between the dura mater and the skull, may arise after an accident or spontaneously.
•    
Other medical conditions that affect the meninges include meningitis (usually from a fungal, bacterial, or viral infection) and meningiomas that arise from the meninges, or from meningeal carcinomatoses (tumors) that form elsewhere in the body and metastasize to the meninges.
Other animals
In fish, there is a single membrane known as the primitive meninx.[15] Amphibians and reptiles have two meninges, and birds and mammals have three.[15] In the early 1900s, Giuseppe Sterzi, an Italian anatomist, carried out comparative studies on the meninges from the lancelet to the human. Contrary to previous reports, the spinal meninges were seen to be very simple, both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates. From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube, only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx. In the following phylogenetic and ontogenetic stages, the latter divides into an internal leaflet: the secondary meninx, and into an external one: the dura mater. Finally, in higher vertebrates, even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia. In the same animals, Sterzi demonstrated that, while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity, in the skull it fuses with the periosteum. He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale.
Mammals (as higher vertebrates) retain the dura mater, and the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and pia mater.
